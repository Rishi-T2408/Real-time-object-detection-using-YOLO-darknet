# Real-time-object-detection-using-YOLO-darknet
In this model I used coco dataset and pretrained weights to identify the objects around ous<br>
The pretrained weights is called yolov3 and the model is able to recognize 80 objects around ous!!<br>
We have 40 frames per second and we can increase the fps using yolotiny weights but in that case the accuracy decreases<br>
So for having high accuracy and good fps we have to use Nvdia jetson 

<br>Library and technology used-<br>

   Future scope of object detection-<br>
   1-Self driving cars<br>
   2-Can be used in security purposes<br>
   3-Paper-less attendence system<br> and many many more
